    description: |2-
        Activities:
        
        * Leading the development of a computational pipeline to analyze hybrid-capture long-read sequencing data.
        * Analysis of genomic datasets, such as RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and Pacbio long-read SMRT-seq.
        * Apply Machine Learning to identify RNA-based neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy.

  - title: Research Associate (Bionformatics)
    company: Institute for Immunology and Cancer Research, University of Montreal
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: org-x
    location: Canada
    date_start: '2012-10-01'
    date_end: '2016-06-30'
    description: |2-
        Activities:
        
        * Research on T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a prevalent childhood blood cancer.
        * Analysis of genomics data such as RNA-seq, Exome-seq and ChIP-seq. 
        * Analysis of mass spectrometry data (proteomics).
        * Developed a methodology to identify active regulators from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets, which lead to the discovery of a network of genes that initiate T cell leukemia.  
        * Developed a Shiny app to study pathway regulation in ChIP-seq data.
